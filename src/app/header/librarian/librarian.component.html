    <div class="about-me"><h3>WELCOME TO BIBLIO TECHIE</h3>
    <p>
My name is Cori. I created Biblio Techie as a way to help organize reading lists and help boost motivation to bust those 
lists out. I was an avid reader when I was younger, but that slowly changed as I got older. A goal of mine is to start
making a dent in my large physical and digital library like I use to do. Biblio Techie helps keep track of not only you
current library and what you have already read, but what books you are itching to add it it. Use the store finder to find a 
a local bookstore to pick up your new adventure. <br><br>
If you're a little lost on where to start, check out some of my favorite reads below. Who knows, maybe you'll find your new favorite story!
